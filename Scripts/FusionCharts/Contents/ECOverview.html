    <p>Shown below is an example image, where a user can export the chart using the context menu of chart. </p></td>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Using FusionCharts export charts routine, you can do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Export charts as images (JPEG, PNG) or PDFs at client-side or server-side. In either case, the chart first needs to render in browser. You cannot directly export the chart as images/PDFs on server until the chart has rendered in browser.</li>
        <li>When using server-side export, you can save the exported output on server's disk at a configurable location. This allows you to later embed those charts in your emails or reports. </li>
        <li>When using client-side export, you can use our batch export process to export all charts present on a page as a single image or PDF in just one click.</li>
        <li>Configure callback JavaScript functions that get invoked after the export process has completed. This helps you show a custom waiting message to the user during the chart export process and also integrate your export process with dynamic scripts and AJAX components </li>
        <li>Configure cosmetic properties of the client-side export handler User Interface. The client-side export handler is the component used to convert charts as images when opting for client-side export. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're already excited about how all of this can be attained, let's quickly first see what happens behind the scenes so that you get a good understanding of the entire process. </p></td>
