You can use data from any spreadsheet - it's just for demo that we're using Microsoft Excel in this example. </p>
    <p>For our example, we've our monthly sales data stored in an Excel worksheet as under: </p></td>

    <p>If you're copying from other sources, you need to judge your delimiter and then set it accordingly. Delimiter is the character that separates two different data items on a single row of data. For example, in our above data, our month names and revenue figures are separated by a <span class="codeInline">Tab</span> character. So, we select <span class="codeInline">Tab</span> as the delimiter. </p>
    <p>Now, you've two options to convert it into XML:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You can directly convert this data into XML without making any changes to it.</li>
      <li>Or, you can edit this data in the grid and then convert it to XML.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>To choose option 1, click on &quot;<span class="codeInline">Convert to XML</span>&quot; button. You'll instantly get the XML as under:  </p></td>
