      <p>While developing these applications in PHP, we  realized that a set of built-in PHP functions  could save us a lot of time by performing various chart generation tasks! Having said that, we release  FusionCharts PHP Class for FusionCharts v3! This class has some PHP  functions that can be used while chart configuration , XML generation and rendering. </p>
      <p>In the coming sections we will see how to use FusionCharts   PHP Class effectively so that charting with PHP becomes easier than ever!</p></td>
