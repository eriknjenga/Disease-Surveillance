  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Before trying the examples from our download package, you need to undertake the necessary setup steps as under:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When running the server-side examples, make sure that you've copied-pasted the relevant export handlers (server-side) to your server. Next, in each example XML, provide the path to that handler and then try again.</li>
        <li>When running client-side examples, make sure that you've copied-pasted the examples (along with ../FusionCharts folder) to your server (either localhost or remote). The reason why they would not work on local files ystem is that Adobe Flash Player blocks Flash to JavaScript communication on local file system for security reasons, which FusionCharts uses for client-side exporting. If you need to over-ride that for a specific folder, you'll need to visit <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flash player/help/settings_manager04.html</a> and then in that interface add the folder containing our examples to the list of allowed folder. </li>
      </ul>
    <p>If it still doesn't work, switch the debug mode of chart to on and it'll be able to guide as to what might be wrong. </p></td>

    <td valign="top" class="text">This CANNOT be done. FusionCharts necessarily needs to render once in the browser, before any of the export handlers are called. This is because the charts are always generated at client-side. After that, it takes a snapshot to the client-side Export component or server-side Export scripts for generation of image/PDFs. </td>

      <ul>
        <li>You've Flash Player 10 installed. FusionCharts Export Component has been coded in Flash CS4 and needs Adobe Flash Player 10 to run. </li>
        <li>You've included <span class="codeInline">FusionChartsExportObject.js</span> in your page (after <span class="codeInline">FusionCharts.js</span>)  </li>
        <li>The constructor of <span class="codeInline">FusionChartsExportObject</span> correctly specified the path to <span class="codeInline">FCExporter.swf</span> </li>
