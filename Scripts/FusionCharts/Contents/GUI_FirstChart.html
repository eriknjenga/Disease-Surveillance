      <li><strong>SWF File</strong> for the chart that you want to create. We 
        want to create a 3D Column Chart, whose SWF file is named 
        as <span class="codeInline">Column3D.swf</span>. All the chart SWF files 
        are present in <span class="codeInline">Download Package</span> &gt; <span class="codeInline">Charts</span> folder. </li>
      <li><strong>FusionCharts JavaScript File </strong>- This file (<span class="codeInline">FusionCharts.js</span>) is present in <span class="codeInline">Download Package &gt; JSClass </span>folder. </li>
      <li><strong>XML Data File</strong>. As you already know by now, FusionCharts accepts data only in 
        a pre-defined XML format. We'll build the XML data using our visual tool soon. </li>
      <li><strong>HTML Wrapper File</strong>. This HTML file would contain the 
        code to embed the chart. Again, we'll build this using the visual tool.  </li>

For each chart that you create using the FusionCharts visual GUI, you'll need to create a separate folder. </p>
    <p class="highlightBlock">You can also have multiple charts in same folder. But, for that you'll need to do some code editing which is discussed in &quot;Guide for Web Developers&quot; section. Here, we've tried to keep things as simple as possible. </p>

Similar to number prefix, number suffix characters gets added at the end of all the numbers on the chart. </p>
      <p>Next, FusionCharts allows you to choose a palette (color theme) from 5 pre-defined palettes. Lastly, you can choose whether to format your numbers by scaling them into K (Thousands), M (Millions).
