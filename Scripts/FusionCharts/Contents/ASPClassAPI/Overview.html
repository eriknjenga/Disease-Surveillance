      <p>While developing these applications in ASP, we  realized that a set of built-in ASP functions  could save us a lot of time by performing various chart generation tasks. Having that said, we release  FusionCharts ASP Class for FusionCharts v3! This class has some ASP  functions that can be used while  configuring and rendering the chart, and for XML generation. </p>
      <p>In the coming sections we would see how to use FusionCharts   ASP Class effectively so that charting with ASP becomes easier than ever!</p></td>
