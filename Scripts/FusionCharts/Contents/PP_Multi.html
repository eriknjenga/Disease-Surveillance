For this example, we'll build another XML representing sales of previous year (2005) and save the XML as <span class="codeInline">Data2005.xml</span> in the same folder. </p>
    <p>So, if you've 10 charts in your Presentation, you need to build 10 different XML files, each having a unique name - but all in the same folder as .ppt and .swf. </p></td>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>We've first provided the full path of our line chart (the second chart that we add to this presentation). </p>
    <p>After that, we've appended the name of the XML Data   file which we want this chart to plot from. In this example, since our data file is named as<span class="codeInline"> Data2005.xml</span>, so we've appended <span class="codeInline">?dataURL=Data2005.xml</span> to the name of our chart SWF file.</p>
    <p>For our previous chart, we've still used the default data file for FusionCharts - <span class="codeInline">Data.xml</span>. If you wish to change that, you can do it in a similar way - change the name of XML file and then append it as <span class="codeInline">dataURL</span> at the end of SWF File name.   </p>
    <p>When you now view the presentation, you'll find our previous column chart in the first slide and line chart in the second slide. If the line chart doesn't show up or animate, right click on it and select play when viewing the presentation. </p></td>
