    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>This section is meant for users who have implemented v3.0.x of FusionCharts in their applications and are now upgrading   to FusionCharts v3.1.</p>
      <p>All the features of FusionCharts v3.1 are backward compatible with FusionCharts v3.0.7, barring one - exporting charts as images/PDFs. So, if you're not using &quot;Export as image&quot; feature currently, you can just over-write your old chart SWF files with the new ones and the process is complete. However, if you do use the &quot;Export as image&quot; functionality and wish to use the new features of v3.1, please follow the steps below. </p>

    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Since FusionCharts now allows export of charts at both server and client side, there have been substantial changes in implementation. If you're currently using v3.0.x with server-side saving set as on, you'll need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Update your chart SWF files with the new v3.1 SWF files</li>
        <li>Update your server-side image-saving scripts with the new FusionCharts  Export Handlers (server-side image saving scripts). </li>
        <li>If you intend to save the charts on server, you'll have to configure the parameters in chart XML, as well as specify the temporary folder path in server-side FusionCharts Export Handlers.</li>
        <li>To choose another export format for the image, you'll again have to change the  parameter in chart XML.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>If you intend to use the new client-side FusionCharts Exporter Component, please follow the instructions in the section &quot;Exporting as Image/PDF&quot; </p></td>

Please note that dynamic sizing with respect to browser is still not possible i.e., if you resize your browser, the charts would NOT resize accordingly. </td>
