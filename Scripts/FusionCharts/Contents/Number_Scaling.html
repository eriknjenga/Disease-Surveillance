    <p>By default, if your numbers on the chart are greater than 1000, FusionCharts scales them to K (Thousands) or M (Millions). For example, if you plot a chart with data as 12500, 13400 and 13300, you'll see the following chart: </p></td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>FusionCharts, by default, has 1000,1000 (K,M) scaling defined for all charts. It doesn't have the scaling for billions defined. Let's modify the number scaling to add billion so that the final scale looks like 1000,1000,1000 (K,M,B).  </p>
      <p>This scale, in human terms, would look something as under:</p>
      <p>1000 = 1 K<br />
      1000 K = 1 M<br />
      1000 M = 1 B</p>
    <p>Now, to convert this scale into FusionCharts XML format,   you'll have to do the following: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Define your own scale for the chart as under:<br />
        <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart numberScaleValue='1000,1000,1000'   numberScaleUnit='K,M,B' &gt;</span><br />
        <br />
        If you carefully see this and   match it with previous table, you'll find that whatever numeric figure was present on the left hand   side of the table is put in <span class="codeInline">numberScaleValue</span> and   whatever unit was present on the right side of the scale table has been put under   <span class="codeInline">numberScaleUnit</span> - all separated by commas. </li>
      <li>Set the chart formatting flags to on as under:<br />
        <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart formatNumber='1' formatNumberScale='1' ..&gt;</span></li>
      </ol>    
    <p>When you now view a chart containing data in billions, you'll see as under. Note that the chart now contains figure both in millions and billions. </p>    </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="text"><p>Let's consider another example where we intend to plot time related figures on the chart. Say we're plotting a chart which indicates the time taken by a list of   automated processes. Each process in the list can take time ranging from a few   seconds to few days. And we've the data for each process in seconds itself.   Now, if we were to show all the data on the chart in seconds only, it won't   appear too legible. What we can do is build a scale indicating time and then specify   it to the chart. This scale, in human terms, would look something as under:</p>
      <p>60 seconds = 1 minute<br />
        60 minute = 1 hr<br />
        24 hrs = 1 day<br />
        7 days = 1   week</p>
    <p>Now, to convert this scale into FusionCharts  XML format,   you'll have to do it as under:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First you would need to define the unit of the data which you're providing.   Like, in this example, you're providing all data in seconds. So, default number   scale would be represented in seconds. We can represent it as under:<br />
        <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart defaultNumberScale='s' ...&gt; </span></li>
      <li>Next, we define our own scale for the chart as under:<br />
        <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart numberScaleValue='60,60,24,7'   numberScaleUnit='min,hr,day,wk' &gt;</span><br />
        <br />
        Again, if you carefully see this and   match it with our range, you'll find that whatever numeric figures are present on the left hand   side of the range is put in <span class="codeInline">numberScaleValue</span> and   whatever units are present on the right side of the scale has been put under   <span class="codeInline">numberScaleUnit</span> - all separated by commas. </li>
      <li>Set the chart formatting flags to on as under:<br />
        <span class="codeInline">&lt;chart formatNumber='1' formatNumberScale='1' ..&gt;</span> </li>
      </ol>
    <p>The entire XML looks as under: </p>
    <p class="codeInline">&lt;chart defaultNumberScale='s' numberScaleValue='60,60,24,7' numberScaleUnit='min,hr,day,wk'&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;set label='A' value='38' /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;set label='B' value='150' /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;set label='C' value='11050' /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;set label='D' value='334345' /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;set label='E' value='1334345' /&gt;<br />
&lt;/chart&gt;</p>
    <p>When you now view the chart, you'll see that all the data has been   automatically scaled to the best value. Like:</p>
    <p>38 was converted to 38s<br />
      150 was converted to 2.50min<br />
      11050 was   converted to 3.07hr<br />
      334345 was converted to 3.87 day<br />
      1334345 was converted   to 2.21wk<br />

        1024 bytes = 1 KB<br />
        1024 KB = 1 MB<br />
        1024 MB   = 1 GB<br />
        1024 GB = 1 TB</p>
    <p>And the XML can be written as under:</p>
    <p class="codeInline"> &lt;chart   defaultNumberScale='bits' numberScaleValue='8,1024,1024,1024,1024'   numberScaleUnit='bytes,KB,MB,GB,TB' &gt;</p></td>

        3 feet = 1 yard<br />
        1760 yards = 1 mile</p>
